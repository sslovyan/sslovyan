## My [Project Portfolio](https://github.com/sslovyan/Personal-Projects)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing a risk assessment model for prescribed burns as part of my capstone project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use airflow and papermill to build data pipelines. 
- âš¡ Fun fact:  I started CrossFit on April 10th, 2022.  This is the most fun I've had working out in a long time!
- ðŸ‘¯ Special thanks to my lovely and amazing wife for supporting me and our family over the last few years while I juggle work-family-school and also for pushing me to get into CrossFit.  I wouldn't be where I am today without you.  I love you!  <br><br>
